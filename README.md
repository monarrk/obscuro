# Obscuro
"Obscuro - Algo que es confuso o dif√≠cil de entener"

A WIP kernel.

### Credit
This kernel, especially in the beginning, uses an extremely large amount of code from [this awesome tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com).

### Building 
Dependancies:
 - Cargo xbuild
 - Cargo bootimage
 - Qemu?

To build, use `sys/x.sh` (if you want to reverse this, you can use `sys/delete.sh`).

### Testing
This has been tested with Qemu. To run, use `sys/test.sh`
